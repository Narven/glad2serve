# glad2serve

Local webserver with goodies

Glad2Serve is a utility that runs a local server and comes packed with some useful tools/assets to help developing websites locally.
Useful if you have bad internet connection or no connection at all.

Currently provides:
* [Bootstrap CSS](http://localhost:4500/bootstrap.min.css)
* [Bootstrap JS](http://localhost:4500/bootstrap.min.js)

The idea is to provide the most of these tools/libraries while trying to keep the binary file small.

### Install

Just download from the releases for your correct OS.

### Usage

`g2s serve` by default uses port 4500

[http://localhost:4500](http://localhost:4500)

Specify the port
`g2s serve -p 9000`
