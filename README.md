# jam

Jam is a utility that runs a local server and comes packed with some useful tools/assets to help developing websites locally. Useful if you have bad internet connection or no connection at all.

Currently provides:
* [Bootstrap CSS](http://localhost:3000/bootstrap.min.css) with [.map](http://localhost:3000/bootstrap.min.css.map)
* [Bootstrap JS](http://localhost:3000/bootstrap.min.js) with [.map](http://localhost:3000/bootstrap.min.js.map)

The idea is to provide the most of these tools/libraries while trying to keep the binary file small.
