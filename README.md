# jam

Jam is a utility that runs a local server and comes packed with some useful tools/assets to help developing websites locally. Useful if you have bad internet connection or no connection at all.

Currently provides:

* [http://localhost:3000/bootstrap.min.css](Bootstrap CSS) with `.map`
* [http://localhost:3000/bootstrap.min.js](Bootstrap JS) with `.map`

The idea is to provide the most of these tools/libraries while trying to keep the binary file small.
